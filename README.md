# Login-and-Register
This is a simple registration and login form that uses a PDO extension (supported by PHP 7.1) to send and obtain user information from the database. The users' passwords are stored in the database with the password_hash() function and the PASSWORD_DEFAULT bcrypt hashing algorithm.
